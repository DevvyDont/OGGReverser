# OGG Reverser
A silly little tool that will reverse all OGG files using python

## Prereqs

### Setting up
If you just want to use the pre generated content pack for clash/ttr that this tool was made for, head on over
to the releases tab and download `reverse-clash.mf` or `reverse-ttr.mf` (depending on what game) and place it in the `resources/contentpacks` directory (clash) or `resources` directory (ttr) where your
game files are located

If you would like to reverse your own ogg files, then you will need to clone/download this repository and have
python 3 installed and keep reading these instructions

### Dependencies
This repository relies on python 3 and to pip install whatever is in requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the tool

To run the tool locally and reverse your own OGG files, follow the steps below:
- Obviously make sure you have python 3 installed, recommended python 3.10
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the command line in the project directory to install dependencies
- Place whatever OGG sound files you would like to reverse in the `target` directory
  - Note: These files can be in any structure that you would like, meaning you can have subdirectories of OGG files as well!
- Now you should be able to run `main.py` using python 3 and the tool should start reversing your files
  - Note: If you are working on a few hundred files, this will take some time so be patient and wait for it to say it is done!
- Once the tool finishes running, all of your reversed OGG files will now be in the `output` directory maintaining the same structure that you had in the `target` folder


### Optional - Unpacking and Packing multifiles for Panda3D

As this tool was intended to be used to create content packs in TTCC, some scripts have been provided to make 
the game file extraction/compression process faster and less of a headache, and to work seamlessly with this tool

If you would simply like to reverse all sounds contained in an mf file (panda3d gamefiles or another content pack) 
follow these steps:
- In the target folder, place the mf files that you would like to extract (game files or another content pack)
- Run the `unpackmf.bat` script. This will extract all those mf files you placed so you can browse the game files directly
- Run the tool as normal as described above (run `main.py`) and wait for the tool to finish
- Now that all the OGG files are reversed in the `output` directory, you can now run the `packmf.bat` script. This will pack the newly reversed OGG files into `reverse.mf` (click into the `output` folder then `target`) which can be used as a content pack for clash and ttr
